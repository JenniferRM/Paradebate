# A bog standard round with one speaker, three advisors, and one trickster
# The number is right but the confidence is low so its not worth a lot

.90	30	60	55.6	Alice|Bob,Carol,Donald|Elizabeth



# The numbers should be convertable to floats by pythons float()
# Also, the only requirement is that there be one speaker
# In this round, Bob had *only* tricksters talking to him...
# All tricksters profit when he's three orders of mag over his high end.
