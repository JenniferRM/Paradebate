# Game played at Southern California Less Wrong Meetup on Feb 27, 2011 
#
# Questions came from Wits & Wagers cards
#
# Scoring was fuzzy based on code that (hopefully):
#   Rewarded narrow error bars around high confidence accuracy
#   Made penalties for errors lower when low confidence was expressed
#   Generally encouraged well calibrated contributions
#
# Its still not clear what the best way to mesh human game experiences
# with a scoring algorithm.
#
# The probabilities expressed in the first column are confidence.
# (IE the subjective probability of being *right* is expressed.)
